# enhance_catalog
 
Here I store the codes I use to get eqcorrscan running. 

workflow: convert_redpy.py -> create_tribe.py -> scan_data.py -> relocate_catalog.py -> plot_hypo.py

config.py is work in progress... might consolidate all user-defined params in one input text file in the future
currently every code in the workflow works standalone
